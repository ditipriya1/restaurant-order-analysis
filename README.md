# restaurant-order-analysis
This project analyzes over 12K orders from a fictional restaurant chain using SQL and Power BI. Key insights include top-performing menu items, peak ordering hours, and customer behavior trends. Built as part of my data analytics portfolio to demonstrate dashboarding, storytelling, and SQL skills.

🧩 Dataset Overview
The dataset simulates a mid-sized restaurant’s order history, containing:

order_details: individual order transactions with item quantity, price, date, time, etc.

menu_items: item names, categories, and pricing.

All data is fictional and was created for educational purposes.

🔍 Business Objective
"How can we optimize our menu and operations based on ordering trends and customer preferences?"

As a Business Analyst, the goal was to extract meaningful insights that would help a fictional restaurant chain (let’s call it UrbanBite) make informed decisions around:

Menu optimization

Staffing during peak hours

Strategic promotions

📊 Tools Used
SQL (MySQL, DBeaver) — for querying, cleaning, and analyzing raw order data

Power BI — for creating a dynamic and insightful dashboard

GitHub — for version control and documentation

📌 Key Insights
🥗 Three items dominated orders, accounting for over 15% of total sales. (Generic item names used for respectful cultural presentation.)

🕒 Over 50% of all orders occurred between 12 PM to 4 PM, indicating a strong lunch rush.

🧾 Item price and quantity patterns revealed high-volume, low-price strategies driving bulk orders.

📈 Certain item categories showed stronger repeat order rates, which could inform promotional strategies.

📘 Business Recommendations
Consider promoting best-selling items via loyalty or upsell campaigns.

Align staffing and prep during peak hours (esp. lunch time).

Introduce combo offers for top ordered categories to increase average order value.
