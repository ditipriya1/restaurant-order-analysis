# 🍽️ Restaurant Order Analysis — SQL + Power BI

This project analyzes over **12K+ orders** from a fictional restaurant chain using **SQL** and **Power BI**.  
Key insights include **top-performing menu items**, **peak ordering hours**, and **customer behavior trends**.  
It was built as part of my **data analytics portfolio** to demonstrate my skills in **dashboarding, business storytelling, and SQL-based data exploration**.
